# bike-and-code
cycling is my passion an coding is my new area i will discover!

after i studied some html and css code, i tried to write my first own small website. 
somewhere you have to start and i for me, it will be right here!
So i decided to choice two of my main interests: cycling is my passion since a few years, so I can talk a lot about it and I have a lot of content to show; however coding is new to me and I want to learn more about it!

It will by a great benefit for me to combine this to topics. 
Here I go!
